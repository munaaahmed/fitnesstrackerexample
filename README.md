## Description
This project is a tracker that allows you to track your workouts. It allows you to easily log in your workouts as well as check out your fitness statistics. 

## Installation
Clone to VS Code. Open a terminal and "npm init" to get packages. You also need to install MONGODB as well as node server. 

## Functionally
It allows users to track workouts and use the statistics to further improve their workouts.

## Challenges
There were a fair share of challenges when working on this application. My main trouble was connecting the application to my MONGODB data base. I also had trouble with my files. As in the connection between my server file, routes, etc. Overall I got the app running to the best of my abilities.
